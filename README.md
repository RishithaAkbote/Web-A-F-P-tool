# Project1: Generic Website Traffic Analyser and Forecasting Tool

As part of Markatlas' vision to provide clients with a comprehensive Traffic Analyzer and Forecasting Tool, we aim to deliver a solution capable of analyzing and predicting website traffic across various domains such as e-commerce, Ed-tech, and organizational websites.

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a Generic Website Traffic Analyzer and Forecasting Tool for Markatlas to analyze and predict website traffic across multiple e-commerce, Ed-tech, and organizational websites. The tool should be capable of collecting, validating, manipulating, visualizing, and forecasting website traffic data, and should be productized for easy deployment and use.

## Design Steps for Data Analysts

### Data Collection via API

**Parameters Needed:**
- URL of the website(s) to analyze
- Timeframe for data collection (start date, end date)
- Granularity of data (hourly, daily, etc.)

**Storage and Format:**
- Store data in a structured database (e.g., SQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) depending on scalability needs.
- Use CSV or JSON format for data storage and interchange, ensuring compatibility with visualization and forecasting modules.

**Additional Information:**
- Ensure API supports HTTPS for security.
- Implement pagination for large datasets.
- Consider API rate limiting and retries for robustness.

### Data Validation & Manipulation

**Validation:**
- Validate incoming data for completeness, correctness, and consistency.
- Handle missing or erroneous data gracefully.

**Manipulation:**
- Clean and preprocess data (e.g., handle outliers, normalize data if necessary).
- Aggregate data to desired granularity (if raw data is too detailed).

### Data Visualization

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Use libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, or Plotly for interactive and informative visualizations.

**Visualizations:**
- Create charts (line graphs, bar charts) for historical traffic trends.
- Include dashboard views with key metrics (total visits, unique visitors, bounce rate, etc.).

### Data Forecasting

**Models:**
- Implement time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).

**Prediction Intervals:**
- Provide confidence intervals around forecasts to indicate uncertainty.

**Visualization:**
- Display forecasted traffic alongside historical data to compare trends and predictions.

### Implementation

**Integration:**
- Integrate predictive models into the tool to generate forecasts automatically.

**Output:**
- Display predictions for future time periods (e.g., next month, next quarter) based on historical data.

### Repository and Deployment

**GitHub Repository:**
- Create a repository with clear documentation and README for setup instructions.
- Include version control for collaborative development.

**Web Deployment:**
- Host the tool as a web application accessible via URL.
- Ensure security measures are in place (e.g., authentication, HTTPS).

## Outcome

The final outcome of the project should be a user-friendly web application hosted on a specified URL. Users should be able to:

- View visualized historical website traffic data.
- Access predictions and forecasts for future traffic trends.
- Navigate through intuitive dashboards and charts that summarize key metrics.

By following these steps, the Data Analysts can systematically design and develop the Generic Website Traffic Analyzer and Forecasting Tool, meeting the organizational needs of Markatlas effectively.
